WS exercise
As I mentioned in the interview, I am working on my own webpage, and it just contains the first requirement you asked, so I send the js file to you as the first part of my exercise. (File: server.js)

In this file, my link is locally on my Mac ip with port 3000. It will response the index.html page to the user. The main page is some family pics without any css elements, and there is a link ‘MOVIE” point to a folder called videos which contains some videos. Also, I use some function to monitor the changes of the folder, so when the files in the videos changed, it will refresh the web to update the changes. There are also some hidden folders are not exposed yet.

For the second one. I have never used SQL / SQLite on JS, so I assume that the way about writing require is correct, and it will load the users table from db and write into json and response to the users.  (File: sql.js)
